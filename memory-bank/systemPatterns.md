# System Patterns

## System Architecture
The application is a React application that uses Supabase for data storage and authentication.

## Key Technical Decisions
-   Using React for the front-end.
-   Using Supabase for the back-end.

## Design Patterns in Use
-   Component-based architecture.
-   Hook-based state management.

## Component Relationships
-   The `App` component is the root component.
-   The `TaskBoard` component displays the tasks.
-   The `AddTaskDialog` component allows users to add tasks.
